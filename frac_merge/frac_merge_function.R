## FRAC_MERGE, fraction consolidation code, Author: Jim Junker
## Last Updated: Sept. 2016
## code runtime for a data set with a single stream is currently 49 secs
##Purpose: This code automates consolidation of fractioned invertebrate samples for secondary production estimation. 
##	It sums invert size classes across small and large fractions within sites, dates, repilcates, habitats, and taxa while accounting for variable subsampling 
##	practices among split fractions. Further, it scales samples to a common areal basis from raw count-size class input data while being flexible for potential 
##	changing sampler area. It outputs a new .csv file with all sample's fractions summed and merged and on a areal basis.
#
##	Data should maintain the following form with exact column headings in columns 1-8
#
###	SITE	SAMPLE	FRACTION	SUBSAMPLE	AREA_COR	DATE		HABITAT	TAXON		0.25	0.5	1	1.5...
#	HVER	2		>1MM		1		0.09		08/02/2011	COBBLE	OSTRACOD	0	0	2	2
#	HVER	2		>1MM		1		0.09		08/02/2011	COBBLE	MIDGE		0	0	10	7
#	HVER	2		<1MM		16		0.09		08/02/2011	COBBLE	OSTRACOD	0	0	6	10
#	HVER	2		<1MM		16		0.09		08/02/2011	COBBLE	TUBIFICID	0	10	5	0
#	HVER	4		>1MM		1		0.09		08/02/2011	COBBLE	LIMNOPHORA	0	0	0	0
#	.

## Notes: 
##	SITE can handle an unlimited number of sites
##	SAMPLE number is detected and can handle unequal sample numbers across site/date/habitat/etc.
##	FRACTION only handles 2 fractions labled ">1MM" and "<1MM". A warning is given if a sample does not contain paired sample fractions, so empty samples must be input
##	SUBSAMPLE This represents the fraction. Counts will be multiplied by this number
##	AREA_COR This represents the proportion of 1 meter^2 covered with the sampler. Counts are divided by this proportion to scale to ind. * m^-2 
##	DATE This is the date of sampling. This must be in the form of MM/DD/YYY (sample date: "1/5/2008", "9/15/2007", etc.). This maintains the format for further
##		secondary production estimation.
##	HABITAT For habitat specific production. This is necessary for further secondary production estimation.
##	TAXON This is the taxon information used for each group to merge. This code will merge all taxon with exactly matching names within samples.
##	Column 9 - n (as many as needed) These headings denote mm size classes. The values in these columns are abundances in the sample/subsample.
##		There is no requirement for these to be in order or in constant intervals. All columns should be filled in with counts or zeros. Truly missing data
##		should be filled with "NA". There is no need to include all non-occurrences of taxa, but will work fine if it does.. 
##
##	When loading in the data file be sure to turn name checking off otherwise  
##	(i.e. DATA <- read.table(C:\DATA.txt, header = T, sep = "\t", quote = "", strip.white = T, check.names = F))
